In Python, loops are control flow structures that allow you to repeatedly execute a block of
code. They are used to iterate over sequences, such as lists, strings, and other iterable
objects, to perform a set of operations multiple times. Python supports two main types of
loops: for loops and while loops.


1. For Loop with Range:
# This loop iterates over a range of numbers from 0 to 4.
for i in range(5):
    print(i)

2. For Loop with List:
# This loop iterates over each element in the list fruits.
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)

3. While Loop:
# This while loop continues executing as long as the condition count < 5 is true.
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
4. Nested For Loops:
# This example shows nested loops,
# with the outer loop iterating 3 times and the inner loop iterating 2 times for each outer iteration.
for i in range(3):
    for j in range(2):
        print(i, j)
5. Looping Through Dictionary:
# This loop iterates over the key-value pairs of a dictionary.
student_grades = {'Alice': 95, 'Bob': 87, 'Charlie': 92}
for name, grade in student_grades.items():
    print(name, grade)
6. Looping Through String:
# This loop iterates over each character in the string "Python".
for char in "Python":
    print(char)
7. Breaking Out of a Loop:
# This loop prints numbers from 0 to 9 but breaks out when i reaches 5.
for i in range(10):
    if i == 5:
        break
    print(i)
8. Continue Statement:
# This loop prints only odd numbers by skipping even numbers using the continue statement.
for i in range(10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        continue
    print(i)
9. Looping with Else Block:
# The else block is executed when the loop completes without encountering a break.
for i in range(5):
    print(i)
else:
    print("Loop finished without a break.")

# The zip function combines two lists element-wise for iteration.
names = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']
ages = [25, 30, 22]
for name, age in zip(names, ages):
    print(name, age)

# The range function with step 2 generates numbers from 0 to 8 (exclusive) with a step of 2.
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)
14. Looping in Reverse:
# The reversed function reverses the order of the elements in the specified iterable.
for i in reversed(range(5)):
    print(i)
15. Looping with Sorted List:
# The sorted function returns a sorted version of the specified iterable.
numbers = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2]
for num in sorted(numbers):
    print(num)

# This while loop continues indefinitely until the break statement is triggered.
